## Mi 1er proyecto en Github desde RStudio

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Firts steps installing packages in RStudio

#### Install the packages
```{r}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")

```

#### Load ggplot2 and the dataset
```{r}
# library(ggplot2)
# library(palmerpenguins)
```

#### Examine the data frame for the penguins data.
```{r}
# data("penguins")
# View(penguins)
```
It will appear a dataset as this:
![Dataset](dataset.png)

### Created the plot in ggplot2

#### Created a scatterplot of points displaying the relationship between the variables of flipper length on the x-axis and body mass on the y-axis about the 3 penguin species.

```{r}
#ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```
 
![Scatterplot](plot-penguins.png)
The plot shows a positive relationship between the two variables. In other words, the larger the penguin, the longer the flipper. 

#### Created 2nd plot

```{r}
# ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(color=species)) + facet_wrap(~species)
```

![Scatterplot](plot_species_color.png)
to add title to the plot we have to put the code line at the end: labs(title = "Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs Flipper Length"), that's going to change from the previous facet to this one.


```{r}
# ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(color=species)) + facet_wrap(~species) + labs(title = "Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs Flipper Length")
```

### Tips to remember:
- R is case-sensitive, so it's important to pay attention how we are writting
- Be sure we're using parentheses and quotation marks every time, and put them in pairs, for example: "" or (). This is because if we just write one of them, we will have an error in our code.
- If you want to add a new layer on your plot, you have to use the plus sign (+) at the end of the line.
- If you want to know what a specific function put the line: ?function_name, which will explain in detail what the parameters mean, and also provide examples of that function.
- Also you could ask your question in Stackoverflow or with the R Community.
